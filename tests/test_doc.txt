# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence
processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes
include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability
to automatically learn and improve from experience without being
explicitly programmed.

## Applications

AI is being used in various fields including:
- Healthcare for diagnosis and treatment
- Finance for fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Natural language processing
